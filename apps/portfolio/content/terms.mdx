These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the websites and services operated by AliSamadii.LLC ("we," "our," or "us"), including alisamadii.com, motion.alisamadii.com, docs.alisamadii.com, and packages.alisamadii.com (the "Services"). By using our Services, you agree to these Terms.

## Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## Use of the Services

You may use the Services only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to:

- Use the Services in any way that violates applicable laws or regulations
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the Services, other accounts, or related systems
- Transmit any malware, spam, or other harmful or disruptive content
- Scrape, copy, or misuse content or data from the Services except as permitted (e.g., public documentation)

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access to the Services for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to others.

## Accounts and Sign-In

Some parts of the Services may require an account. You may sign in using your email and password or through third-party providers such as Google. When you use "Sign in with Google" or similar, you allow us to receive certain profile information from that provider as described in our Privacy Policy. You are responsible for keeping your account credentials secure and for all activity under your account.

## Intellectual Property

The Services, including their design, content, code, and branding, are owned by AliSamadii.LLC or our licensors. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works without our prior written permission, except where we explicitly allow it (e.g., open-source code or documentation under their respective licenses).

## Disclaimer of Warranties

The Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, AliSamadii.LLC and its affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising from your use of or inability to use the Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total liability for any claims related to the Services shall not exceed the amount you paid us, if any, in the twelve months preceding the claim.

## Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless AliSamadii.LLC and its affiliates from any claims, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your use of the Services or your violation of these Terms.

## Changes to the Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the updated Terms on this page and update the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Services after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Services.

## Governing Law and Disputes

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the state in which AliSamadii.LLC is established, without regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of that jurisdiction.

## Severability

If any part of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.
