I joined Crosspost in July 2023 as a Frontend Developer, when the project was still just an idea. There was no existing codebase, no UI, and no frontend team — I was the only frontend developer.

At that time, I didn’t have much experience working in a company environment. I was learning constantly from the team, adapting quickly, and taking full ownership of the frontend from day one.

When I first saw the scope of the project, it felt challenging. The app required complex features like video trimming, video editing, and content management. Instead of questioning whether it was possible, I focused on building step by step and solving problems as they came.

I designed and implemented the entire frontend architecture, worked closely with backend developers, and helped turn an idea into a working product.

Below are some of the key features I built and contributed to. Each video demonstrates real functionality from the product and highlights the challenges I solved as the sole frontend developer.
