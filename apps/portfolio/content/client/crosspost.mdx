I started working at Crosspost in July 2023 as a Frontend Developer. The project was not even started yet. I was the first employee and the only frontend developer on the team. I was responsible for building the entire frontend of the app. That time I did not have so much experience working for a company. I was learning a lot from the other developers and the team.

First time seeing the project, it was hard building it. It had trim feature, video editing feature and etc. I didn't say anything whether I can do it or not. I just started working on it.
