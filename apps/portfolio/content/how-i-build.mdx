I build modern, scalable web applications that are fast, maintainable, and production‑ready from day one.

When you work with me, you don’t just get features — you get clean architecture, thoughtful structure, and a codebase that won’t slow you down six months later.

## My Stack

I use tools that reduce friction and speed up delivery:

- **Next.js 16** — Full‑stack React with server components and streaming
- **tRPC + React Query** — End‑to‑end type safety and smart data caching
- **Cloudflare R2** — Secure, cost‑efficient file storage
- **Tailwind CSS** — Fast, consistent UI development
- **Zustand, Motion, date‑fns** — Clean state, smooth UX, reliable utilities
- **Prettier** — Consistent, readable code

This stack lets me move fast without sacrificing quality.

## Clean Component Architecture

I specialize in turning large, messy components into clean, reusable systems. Smaller components mean easier testing, better performance, and safer updates.

One of my favorite patterns is the **Compound Components pattern** — it creates flexible APIs while keeping the implementation clean and predictable.

## Built to Scale

I focus on:

- Performance
- Type safety
- Clear structure
- Fast iteration

I also use AI to accelerate test writing and reduce boilerplate — so we ship with confidence, not guesswork.

If you're building a SaaS, dashboard, or modern web platform, I can help you ship faster with a foundation that lasts.
